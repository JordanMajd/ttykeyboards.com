I've wanted to design a bluetooth mech keeb for a while; wasn't sure how realistic it would be. Figured a 1 key prototype would be a good jumping off point. Still has a lot of work to be done, but it works.

## Features

- USB C
- BLE 5.0
- Long lasting LIPO battery
- Wireless Qi charging
- Kailh Gold Speed switch
- ffffff

## Roadmap
